### Making solatiare (windows xp version) from scratch using C++ and SDL2

temp placeholder assets from https://60jars.itch.io/card-game-assets

planning to compile to web assembly when the game is playable and host on a website to showcase interactive projects.


## GOALS:
the aim right now is to get a minimum functional game with litle concern to animations and qol features such as a start screen etc.
only a reset button will be added to reset/redeal the game.

## Currently in development / next development milestone:
properly setting up the game board (a specific class will handle this), followed by a draw pile, game setup and logic

## Finished features:
rendering, texture manager, 160fps game loop, partial functionality of card stacks and cards.
ability to move cards between stacks using your mouse.


## why C++/C ? and not C#, javascript etc.
C++ challenges me a bit more, i'm trying not to stay in my comfort zone too much.

##issues
some code is a bit inelegant, needs to be refactored at a later date, currently prioritising MVP
